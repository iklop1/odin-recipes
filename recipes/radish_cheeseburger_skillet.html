        <p>This low-carb cheeseburger skillet with radishes is one of my wife and I's favorite weeknight dishes. It's relatively health, yet hearty and great for a cool fall or winter evening. We love pickels so great pickel slices are a must here. Sometimes we substitute ground turkey for the ground beef and almost always add bacon. Enjoy!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices Center Cut Bacon, cut into strips</li>
            <li>12 oz bag Radishes, quartered</li>
            <li>1 lb Ground Beef</li>
            <li>1/4 C Ketchup</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Mayo</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Dijon or Whole Grain Mustard</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Pickle Juice</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce</li>
            <li>4 oz Shredded Cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Dill Pickle Chips and Fresh Parsley (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat before transferring the cooked bacon to plate, leaving the grease behind.</li>
            <li>Add the quartered radishes to the skillet and cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the radishes start to soften.</li>
            <li>Push the radishes to one side before adding the ground beef. Brown both sides of the ground beef before mincing and fully cooking.</li>
            <li>While the beef cooks, mix the ketchup, mustard, mayo, pickle juice, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl. Once the beef is fully cooked, turn off the heat and add the sauce. Stir to fully incorporate.</li>
            <li>Top with shredded cheese and optional dill pickle chips. Bake in a 400ÂºF oven for about 5 minutes to fully melt the cheese. Top with the cooked and crumbled bacon, fresh parsley (optional), and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
